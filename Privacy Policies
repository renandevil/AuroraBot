# Your ID
* Aurora stores your ID in messages only if configured by those in charge of the current server, for example: Aurora starts to store your ID when the leveling system is activated, so that every message you send earns you a certain value at each 1 minute, which we save in our database so you can level up and earn positions as a reward. Aurora also stores your ID when you use the economy system, some commands give you Aurora's own currency called "Creams", which you can buy at Aurora's own store.

# Your Message
* It is also stored when you set up your biography, information that is only customized if you use the command and set with your own message that is displayed to users. Aurora saves your ID when you ask or accept someone to marry you using the "marry" command, which is part of the roleplay command, Aurora needs to store your ID to know who you are married to, if you are still married and how long you have been married.
